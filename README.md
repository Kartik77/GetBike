# GetBike
GetBike is an online bike renting system where users can authenticate themselves and book a bike for their requirements. This system is designed to help the customers to take bikes or two-wheelers on rent. When we go on any trip outside the town or country we want to be free of time so instead of going through metros and taxis we prefer to have our own vehicle for rent. Using this system customers can register themselves as renters and can take any bike on rent. 
The Admin of the system can add bikes , edit bikes and can manage the bookings.
